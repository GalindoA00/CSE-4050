<h1>My Venture</h1>
<p>This is an About Me Example I am an aspiring data scientist who enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have strong technical skills and an academic background in engineering, statistics, and machine learning.


My passion lies in solving business problems with tailored data and algorithms and communicating complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders. I am able to jump across verticals to deliver high-performing AI solutions.


In my graduate studies, I’ve taken on various leadership roles, including mentoring three undergraduate interns, coordinating institute-wide research events for hundreds of people, and leading two journal clubs.


I'm graduating in May 2019 and I'm interested in full-time data science or machine learning roles. Please feel free to get in touch with me via email at welove@resumeworded.com.


Proficient: ​ Python (scikit-learn, NumPy, SciPy, pandas), TensorFlow, Excel
Knowledgeable: ​SQL, R, Spark (Spark SQL, MLLib, Pyspark)
Familiar: ​ NLP (Natural Language Processing), spaCy</p> 
<br>
<p> As a student of Computer Science at CSUSB, My goal is to continue exploring  the fields of software development, Virtual Reality, Gaming and data science, so I have a clear vision of where I would like to land upon graduation.</p>
